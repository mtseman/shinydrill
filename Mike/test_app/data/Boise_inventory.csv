Team Members may include representatives from Current Planning, Design Review, Subdivisions, Plan Review, Fire, Public Works and a multitude of other disciplines.  The Project Manager will select the Team based on the scope of the project.

Early Assistance meetings are offered through the Project Management Program to identify required applications, establish project timelines and determine if there are any major issues that need to be addressed prior to application submittal.  One or more Early Assistance meetings may be held with varying City Team members.  Project Management is available on a limited basis.  Customers wishing to participate must contact a Project Manager and request consideration.  Projects must meet a specific criteria.  Project Managers have the option to decline an otherwise eligible project base on their workload capacity.
