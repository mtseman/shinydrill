This Program has been an invaluable resource for Customers since inception. 

The Project Managers Role:  The Project Manager acts as the central point of contact, opening the lines of communication by bringing an appropriate City Team together and greatly reducing the amount of time applicants spend going from Department to Department.  The Project Manager assists applicants in understanding the Citys requirements, which enables them to submit complete applications and avoid possible delays.  The Project Manager proactively monitors each projects progress from Planning approvals to Certificate of Occupancy.  In some cases, a multi-disciplinary Team will be assigned to a project.  Team Members may include representatives from Current Planning, Design Review, Subdivisions, Plan Review, Fire, Public Works and a multitude of other disciplines.  The Project Manager will select the Team based on the scope of the project.

Early Assistance meetings are offered through the Project Management Program to identify required applications, establish project timelines and determine if there are any major issues that need to be addressed prior to application submittal.  One or more Early Assistance meetings may be held with varying City Team members.  Project Management is available on a limited basis.  Customers wishing to participate must contact a Project Manager and request consideration.  Projects must meet a specific criteria.  Project Managers have the option to decline an otherwise eligible project base on their workload capacity.
